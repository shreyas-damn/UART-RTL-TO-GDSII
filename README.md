# UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

A synthesizable UART Transmitter and Receiver designed in **SystemVerilog**. The project implements asynchronous serial communication using separate transmitter and receiver finite state machines (FSMs), a configurable baud rate generator, and comprehensive testbenches for functional verification.

---

## Overview

UART is one of the most widely used serial communication protocols in embedded systems. This project implements a basic UART core capable of transmitting and receiving 8-bit data frames.

The design consists of four RTL modules:

- Baud Rate Generator
- UART Transmitter (TX)
- UART Receiver (RX)
- Top-Level UART Integration

Each module has an independent testbench and has been verified using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.

## Features

- Configurable baud rate generator
- UART Transmitter FSM
- UART Receiver FSM
- 8-bit data transmission
- 1 Start Bit
- 1 Stop Bit
- LSB-first transmission
- 16× oversampling in receiver
- Modular RTL design
- Independent testbenches for each module
- Simulation support using Icarus Verilog

## Module Description

### Baud Rate Generator

- Generates baud tick from system clock
- Parameterized clock frequency and baud rate

### UART Transmitter

Implements an FSM with four states:

- IDLE
- START
- DATA
- STOP

Transmits one bit on every baud tick.

### UART Receiver

Implements an FSM that:

- Detects falling edge of start bit
- Waits until the middle of the start bit
- Samples every 16 baud ticks
- Reconstructs received byte

### UART Top

Integrates:

- Baud Generator
- TX
- RX

## Simulation

Each RTL module includes an individual testbench.

To simulate:

```bash
cd scripts
./tx.sh
```

Similarly,

```bash
./baud_gen.sh
./rx.sh
./uart.sh
```

Waveforms are generated in the `sim/` directory and can be viewed using GTKWave.

Example:

```bash
gtkwave sim/tx/tx.vcd
```

---

## Verification

The following functionality has been verified through simulation:

- Baud tick generation
- UART transmission
- UART reception
- End-to-end UART communication
- State machine transitions
- Correct serial data reconstruction
